```

Let's break down the key components of this structure:

### Controllers

The `controllers` directory is split into `api` and `web` subdirectories, separating the logic for API endpoints and web pages. This separation allows for clear organization and makes it easier to maintain and scale your application as it grows.

#### API Controllers

API controllers handle requests that return data, typically in JSON format. These are used for AJAX requests, mobile app integrations, or other services that consume your API.

Example from `controllers/api/auth.go`:

```go
func HandleLogin(c echo.Context) error {
    email := c.FormValue("email")
    password := c.FormValue("password")

    // Validate credentials (simplified for example)
    if email == "user@example.com" && password == "password" {
        return c.HTML(http.StatusOK, `<div id="login-response" class="text-green-500">Login successful!</div>`)
    } else {
        return c.HTML(http.StatusUnauthorized, `<div id="login-response" class="text-red-500">Invalid credentials</div>`)
    }
}
```
### Web Controllers

Web controllers are responsible for rendering full HTML pages or page fragments for server-side rendering.

Example from `controllers/web/auth.go`:

```go
func RenderLogin(c echo.Context) error {
    loginComponent := common.Login()
    return loginComponent.Render(context.Background(), c.Response())
}
```

This controller renders the login page using a Templ component, showcasing the integration between Go, Templ, and server-side rendering.

### Routes

The routes directory organizes the application's URL structure, again separated into api and web subdirectories.

Example from `routes/web/auth.go`:

```go
func RegisterAuthRoutes(g *echo.Group) {
    g.GET("/login", auth_controller.RenderLogin)
    g.GET("/signup", auth_controller.RenderSignup)
    // Other auth-related frontend routes
}
```

This structure allows for clear, modular routing definitions that are easy to maintain and extend.

### Templates

The templates directory contains Templ files, which are compiled to Go code. This approach provides type-safe templating with the performance benefits of compiled code.

Example from `templates/index.templ`:

```html
package templates

import "github.com/vinay1668/go-htmx/templates/common"

templ Index() {
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
            <title>Golang</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/output.css"/>
        </head>
        <body class="bg-[#0F172A]">
            <div>
                @common.Dashboard()
            </div>
            <!-- Your content goes here -->
        </body>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10"></script>
    </html>
}
```

This template demonstrates how Templ integrates with Tailwind CSS and includes HTMX for dynamic interactions.

### Static Files and CSS

The static directory holds assets like images and SVGs, while the css directory contains Tailwind CSS input and output files. This separation keeps your assets organized and makes it easy to manage your styles.

### Configuration Files

- `.air.toml`: Configuration for Air, enabling live-reloading during development.
- `go.mod` and `go.sum`: Go module files for dependency management.
- `Makefile`: Contains useful commands for building and running the project.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS, allowing for customization of the utility framework.

### Why This Structure Works for Scalable Web Apps

The structure of this Go-HTMX template project is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By dividing the application into controllers, routes, and templates, each component has a clear responsibility.
2. **Modularity**: The separation of API and web components allows for easy expansion of either without affecting the other.
3. **Reusability**: Common templates and components can be shared across different parts of the application.
4. **Performance**: Go's compiled nature, combined with Templ's type-safe templates and HTMX's lightweight approach, results in a high-performance application.
5. **Developer Productivity**: The clear structure and use of tools like Air for live-reloading enhance the development experience.
6. **Scalability**: As the application grows, new routes, controllers, and templates can be added without disrupting the existing structure.

## Building with Go + HTMX: A Practical Example

Let's walk through a simple example of how Go and HTMX work together in this template. We'll create a simple dynamic counter that updates without a full page reload.

First, let's add a new route in `routes/web/dashboard.go`:

```go
func RegisterDashboardRoutes(e *echo.Group) {
    e.GET("/", dashboard_controller.RenderDashboard)
    e.GET("/increment", dashboard_controller.IncrementCounter)
}
```

Now, let's implement the controller in `controllers/web/dashboard.go`:

```go
package web

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/labstack/echo"
    "github.com/vinay1668/go-htmx/templates/common"
)

var counter int

func RenderDashboard(c echo.Context) error {
    dashboardComponent := common.Dashboard(counter)
    return dashboardComponent.Render(context.Background(), c.Response())
}

func IncrementCounter(c echo.Context) error {
    counter++
    return c.HTML(200, fmt.Sprintf("<span>%d</span>", counter))
}
```

Next, update the `templates/common/dashboard.templ` file:

```html
package common

templ Dashboard(count int) {
    <div class="min-h-screen bg-[#0F172A] text-white flex flex-col">
        <nav class="p-4">
            <div class="container mx-auto flex justify-between items-center">
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Golang + HTMX</h1>
            </div>
        </nav>
        <div class="flex items-center justify-center flex-grow">
            <div id="main-content" class="w-full max-w-md text-center">
                <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4">Counter: <span id="counter">{ count }</span></h2>
                <button hx-get="/increment" hx-target="#counter" class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
                    Increment
                </button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
}
```

In this example, we've created a simple counter that increments when the button is clicked. HTMX handles the AJAX request and updates only the counter value, demonstrating the seamless integration between Go's server-side logic and HTMX's client-side interactivity.
